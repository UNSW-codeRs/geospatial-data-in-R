# Visualisation of spatial data with Leaflet

**Leaflet** is an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It is a very popular solution for adding spatial data to mobile apps and webpages. 

https://leafletjs.com/ 

## Minimal example
Setting up a Leaflet map in R is really easy: initialize, set a view, add the tiles and add any kind of spatial data on top. 

```{r}
require(leaflet)

leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng = 22.423611 , lat = 37.081944, zoom=4) %>%
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(22.423611 , 37.081944, popup="This is Sparta!")

```

Leaflet maps are interactive, allowing users to zoom in and out and pan around. 

Leaflet maps can be previewed in RStudio, exported as HTML documents or static images, embedded in Rmarkdown documents or Shiny Apps.
