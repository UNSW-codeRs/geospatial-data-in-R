# Visualisation of spatial data with Plotly

**Plotly** offers open-source graphing libraries for several programming languages. 

https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/

## Minimal example

Plotly offers a few options to set up a map, here is a simple example of vector maps with no background tiles:

```{r}
require(plotly)

quakes = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv')

fig <- quakes 
fig <- fig %>%
  plot_ly(
    type = 'densitymapbox',
    lat = ~Latitude,
    lon = ~Longitude,
    coloraxis = 'coloraxis',
    radius = 10) 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      style="stamen-terrain",
      center= list(lon=180)), coloraxis = list(colorscale = "Viridis"))

fig
```
