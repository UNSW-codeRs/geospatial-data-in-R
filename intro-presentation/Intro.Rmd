# Spatial or geospatial?

Think of **spatial data** as ordinary data (vectors or matrices) with spatial properties that we will call geometries. 

$$ \mathrm{spatial} \ \mathrm{data} = \mathrm{data} + \mathrm{geometry} $$
--

Now let's add a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and we get **geospatial data**:

$$ \mathrm{geospatial} \ \mathrm{data} = \mathrm{data} + \mathrm{geometry} + \mathrm{CRS} $$
--

There are several benefits to this:

- CRS translate locations on the earth to planar coordinates and viceversa.
- Compare, overlay and combine spatial data using the same CRS
- Transform coordinates between alternative CRS

---

## Geospatial analysis

Different types of geospatial analysis involves operations on *data*, *geometries* and *CRS*.

--

Some analysis are very simple such as:

- focusing on the **data** and using **geometry** as an aesthetic in plots
- modifying **CRS** to improve visualisation

--

Some analysis require additional steps like:

- using **geometries** to perform spatial operations
- using **geometries** to query **data**
- using **geometries** to modify the **data**

--

And at the higher end, some analysis require very specific models that use both **data** and **geometries** as input 

- geostatistics (Krigging) analysis,
- GLMM with spatial correlation structure,
- Point pattern analysis, etc
---

# Geospatial data types

The two primary types of (geo-)spatial data are raster and vector data. 

**Raster data** is stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a map as pixels or cells. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth’s surface with. **Vector data** structures represent specific features on the Earth’s surface, and assign attributes to those features.

---

## Rasters 

- Raster data is pixelated data where each pixel is associated with a specific location.
- Raster data always has an extent and a resolution.
- The extent is the geographical area covered by a raster.
- The resolution is the area covered by each pixel of a raster.

---

Examples of raster data: aerial photographs, satellite images, precipitation maps, elevation maps, landcover maps, etc.

One common file formats for raster data is the [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) format.

A raster file can contain data on multiple variables stored as **bands** (each band represents one variable) that share the same spatial properties (extent, resolution, etc).

---

## Vectors

- Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earth’s surface, and assign attributes to those features.
- Vectors are composed of discrete geometric locations that define the shape of the spatial object (points, lines, polygons).
- A table of attributes links each spatial object (row) with multiple attributes (columns).

---

Examples of vector data: sampling locations or cities, roads or routes, country boundaries.

There are many file formats for vector data: ESRI Shapefiles are very popular, OGC GeoPackage (GPKG) is an open and standards-based format, GeoJSON is used in many web applications.

## Biologists looking for frogs

Our team is studying if the activity of a frog species in related to vegetation characteristics in a botanical garden (we will call it [JBM](https://iamvenezuela.com/2017/05/jardin-botanico-de-maracaibo-leandro-aristeguieta/#prettyPhoto) for short). They use a paper map of the garden and write down coordinates of each sampling point where they describe characteristics of the vegetation at these points (leaf litter, tree cover, etc).

```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
here::i_am("intro-presentation/Intro.Rmd")

dts <- read_sf(here::here("data","JBM-points.gpkg"))
data_jbm <- dts #%>% mutate(TCC=factor(`Tree cover`))
st_crs(data_jbm) <- NA

```

--

Let's have a glimpse at their data
```{r}
glimpse(data_jbm)
```

---

Here the *geometry* attribute is represented as points with two coordinates, and we can use these coordinates as aesthetics in a plot and represent other categorical variable with size and colour aesthetics.

```{r, dev='svg', message=F, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data_jbm) + 
  geom_sf(aes(size=`Tree cover`, colour=`Tree cover`)) +
  labs(subtitle="Coordinates in meters", x="x", y="y",
       size="Tree\ncover\nclass", colour="Tree\ncover\nclass") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=function(x) x-203000) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels=function(x) x-1171000) +
  guides(color= guide_legend(), size=guide_legend())


```

### Filling gaps: spatial interpolation


For example, our team of biologist collected data about leaf litter in several locations



```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
here::i_am("intro-presentation/Intro.Rmd")

boundary_jbm <- read_sf(here::here("data","JBM.gpkg")) %>% 
  filter(id %in% c(7,8,11))
data_jbm <- read_sf(here::here("data","JBM-points.gpkg"))

rnull <- raster(extent(boundary_jbm),
                nrows=18, ncols=24,
                crs=st_crs(boundary_jbm)$proj4string)
mask <- distanceFromPoints(rnull,data_jbm)<50

ss <- values(mask)==1

prd.grd <- SpatialPixelsDataFrame(
  points=xyFromCell(mask,1:ncell(mask))[ss,],
  data=data.frame(values(mask)[ss]),
  proj4string=CRS(st_crs(boundary_jbm)$proj4string))

```
---

## 

Sometimes coordinates are just additional aesthetics variables in our plots.

--

For example: Consider data about trends in human population size in major cities of the world. 


```{r}
data(metro)
metro
```

---

We use geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to locate each city in the map of the world, and for each city we have several estimates of population size for each decade.

```{r}
metro <- metro %>% mutate(growth = (pop2020 - pop2010)/(pop2010 * 10) * 100)
```


For example if we compare the population size in major cities of the world between 2010 and 2020, we can calculate population growth and use the coordinates to show where are the cities with largest growth.

---

### Visualisation

For example if we compare the population size in major cities of the world between 2010 and 2020, we can calculate population growth and use the coordinates to show where are the cities with largest growth.

```{r}

data(World)

my_map <- tm_shape(World, projection='+proj=robin') + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_text("iso_a3", size = "AREA", col = "gray30", root = 3) +
  tm_shape(metro) + tm_bubbles("pop2010", col = "growth",
  border.col = "black", border.alpha = 0.5,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 2, 4, 6, Inf), palette = "-RdYlGn",
  title.size = "Metro population (2010)",
  title.col = "Annual growth rate (%)", id = "name",
  popup.vars = c("pop2010", "pop2020", "growth")) 

```

---

```{r}
my_map
```


---

### Spatial operations

Calculating distances between datasets

---

### Spatial queries

Comparing two datasets

---



```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4,dev='svg',message=F}
require(gstat)
v = variogram(I(Tree.cover > 2)~1,data_jbm)
vm = fit.variogram(v, vgm(1, "Exp", 70, .1))
plot(v,vm)
```

---

# Spatial analysis in **R**

```{r,message=FALSE}
ik = krige(I(Tree.cover > 2)~1, as_Spatial(data_jbm), prd.grd, vm)


```
.pull-left[
```{r,fig.height=4,fig.width=4,dev='png',message=FALSE}
spplot(ik["var1.pred"],
       main = "ordinary kriging predictions",
       sub = "Z = Tree Cover > 2")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r,fig.height=4,fig.width=4,dev='png',message=FALSE}
spplot(ik["var1.var"],
       main = "ordinary kriging variance",
       sub = "Z = Tree Cover > 2")
