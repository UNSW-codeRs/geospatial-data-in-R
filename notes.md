# Some useful links

I am using content from several tutorials and on-line resources to enhance my presentation and tutorials:

- For showing both plot and code in one slide, I read [Garrick's blogpost](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/decouple-code-and-output-in-xaringan-slides/)

- Font size for code slides: https://community.rstudio.com/t/using-multiple-font-sizes-for-code-chunks/26405/6
