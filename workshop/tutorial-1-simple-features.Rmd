## Welcome

In this tutorial, you will learn some basic steps to start working with (geo)-spatial data in R. I prepared this tutorial as a intuitive "hands on" introduction, but I provide links for those interested in more background and theory. 

We will cover following steps :

* Work with points, lines and polygons (vector data) using package `sf`
  * create spatial objects,
  * apply spatial functions,
* Visualise spatial data :
  * default static plots and `ggplot`
  * interactive exploration with `mapview`

### Setup

I've preloaded the packages for this tutorial with

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(leafpop)
library(units)
```

Throughout this tutorial we will be using the  pipe operator, `%>%`. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations in a way that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. We'll use piping frequently because it considerably improves the readability of code. The pipe is a defining feature of the tidyverse, so we will load this set of packages as well.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The tidyverse package also includes `ggplot2`, which allow us to create static maps in a similar modular fashion, but using the `+` operator instead of the pipe. 

For the first part of this tutorial we will create our own spatial objects. 
Further on, to practice more spatial functions, we will use the `franconia`, `breweries` and `trails` data sets from package `mapview`. These data sets are documented in `help(package=mapview)`.



```{r, eval=TRUE, child="00-intro.Rmd"}

```

###

Now that we have discussed some background on packages for spatial data in R, let's start with our first spatial object.


```{r, eval=TRUE, child="01-create-sf-section.Rmd"}

```

###

We just created our first spatial object, how cool is that?

However, spatial data are often more complex and we want to use R to answer questions about the spatial data, not only display them.

In the next section we will find out some ways to do that.



```{r, eval=TRUE, child="02-points-section.Rmd"}

```


###

We learned how to plot and query spatial and non-spatial information from a `sf` object, well done!

We will come back to the questions of plotting and querying spatial objects when we have a look at other types of spatial objects. Please continue to the next section.

```{r, eval=TRUE, child="03-polygons-section.Rmd"}

```


###

We just learned to work with polygons, how to use spatial functions `st_union`, `st_intersection` and how to plot spatial objects with ``ggplot`, well done!

In the next section we will work with objects in different projections. 


```{r, eval=TRUE, child="04-projection-section.Rmd"}

```


###

We learned to work with lines, how to use spatial functions `st_length` and how to handle projections of spatial objects with ``ggplot` and with the function `st_transform`. Great!

In the last section we will use mapview to explore all the types of data interactively. 


```{r, eval=TRUE, child="05-mapview-section.Rmd"}

```


### That's it from me!

We just learned to use mapview to visualise spatial data interactively.

I hope this has been useful and you feel more confident to start working with geo-spatial data in R.
