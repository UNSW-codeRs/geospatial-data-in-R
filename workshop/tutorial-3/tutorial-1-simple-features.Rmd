## Welcome

In this tutorial, you will learn some basic steps to start working with (geo)-spatial data in R. I prepared this tutorial as a intuitive "hands on" introduction, but I provide links for those interested in more background and theory.

We will cover following steps :

* TO DO

### Setup

I've preloaded the packages for this tutorial with

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(leafpop)
library(units)
```

Throughout this tutorial we will be using the  pipe operator, `%>%`. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations in a way that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. We'll use piping frequently because it considerably improves the readability of code. The pipe is a defining feature of the tidyverse, so we will load this set of packages as well.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The tidyverse package also includes `ggplot2`, which allow us to create static maps in a similar modular fashion, but using the `+` operator instead of the pipe.

For the first part of this tutorial we will create our own spatial objects.
Further on, to practice more spatial functions, we will use the `franconia`, `breweries` and `trails` data sets from package `mapview`. These data sets are documented in `help(package=mapview)`.



```{r, eval=FALSE, child="00-intro.Rmd"}

```

###

Now that we have discussed ...


```{r, eval=FALSE, child="01-create-sf-section.Rmd"}

```


### That's it from me!

We just learned to ...

I hope this has been useful and you feel more confident to start working with geo-spatial data in R.
